Emission node

Principled Hair BSDF node

Mix Shader node
-Takes to shaders and decides which is used more or less
-Works with black and white data for example Fresnel node

Fresnel node

Principled BSDF node(Standard node)
Base Color -> Color
Subsurface -> Subsurface scattering
Specular ->
Specular Tint ->
Metallic -> Metalness
Specular -> How much refelction is possible
Roughness -> Increrase/decrease sharpness of light refelction
Anisotropic ->
Anisotropic Rotation ->
Sheen -> For cloth like materials
Clearcoat -> Adds glossy specular layer ontop of everything (used for car/ boat paint)
IOR - >
Transmission -> turn material in glass like object
Emission -> Strength of the emitted light (however emission node can do more)
Alpha -> Transparency
Normal -> For normal maps node
Clearcoat Normal -> Controls the normals of the Clearcoat layer
Tangent -> Controls the tangent for the Anisotropic layer
