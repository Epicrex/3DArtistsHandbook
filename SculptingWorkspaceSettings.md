### Voxel Remesh
  - DON'T USE DYNTOPO, I used it for about 2 months and then noticed that Voxel Remesh is so so much better. I admit, I was also using relative detail which maid it much worse       but still Voxel Remesh is the way to go.

  - Under Voxel Remesh set a resolution for a human modeI usualy go with a resolution of 0.01 (depending on how good your pc is) and while sculpting use the Hotkey Strg + R to       remesh(you will be using this hotkey alot).

### Focal Length
  - N>View>Focal Length
  - 35 or 50 is normal however something like 80 or 100 is better if you wan't to be able to see more detail. Smaller numbers make you see more of the model with less detail and     higher values make you see less of the model but more detail.

### Mat Cap
  - Viewport Shading>Mat Cap>Click the ball
  - I don't like the normal mat cap and mostly change to the brown clay mat cap, but I'll talk more about mat caps in the mat cap section.

### Topolegy
  - Under Dyntopo turn on Smooth Shading.
  - Turn on Dyntopo (Essential/Automatic Remesh).
  - Change Voxel Resolution with Shift+R and apply with Alt + R.
