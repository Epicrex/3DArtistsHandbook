# Hi
I started using blender x(2020.September) and have ever since been using it almost every day. Always when I learned something new I documented it here so I could later come here to quickly ... . I now feel like it is pretty complete enough and after making it better understandable for others, am happy to share what I learned with everyone that cares to listen (read). If you notice that anything is incorrect or not understandable please let me know in the comments. And I will try to fix it as fast as possible. This guide also isn't finished, it will never be finished because one can never know everything and will always learn new things.
